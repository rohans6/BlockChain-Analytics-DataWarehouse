# BlockChain-Analytics-DataWarehouse

With the exponential growth of the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology, businesses, investors, regulators, and analysts face challenges in obtaining actionable insights from vast blockchain data. Blockchain data is inherently decentralized, unstructured, and rapidly growing, making it difficult to analyze and interpret trends, transactions, and risks efficiently.

The goal is to create a Blockchain Analytics Data Warehouse that can centralize, structure, and process blockchain data for cryptocurrencies to support various stakeholders in making informed decisions, improving operational efficiency, and ensuring compliance.

## Requirements for the Blockchain Data Warehouse:
### 1. Data Sources
1. **Public Blockchain Data:-**

* Transactions: Sender, receiver, amount, timestamp, fees, and confirmations.

* Wallets: Wallet addresses, balances, and transaction history.

* Smart Contracts: Contract addresses, deployed code, and interactions.

2. **Cryptocurrency Market Data:-**
* Prices, volumes, market caps, and historical trends.

* Exchange data: Trading pairs, order books, and liquidity metrics.

3. **Regulatory Data:-**

* Compliance frameworks and suspicious transaction reports.


### 2. Data Warehouse Requirements

Consolidate data from multiple blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) into a unified schema.

2. **Scalability: -**
Support rapid growth in blockchain data.

3. **Data Quality and Integrity:-**
Ensure accurate and consistent data, addressing duplication, missing data, and anomalies.

### 3.Analytics and Reporting
1. **Transaction Analytics:**
* Aggregate daily transaction volumes, fees, and token transfers.
