# Designing a Data Warehouse for Music Store Analytics

The Chinook Music Store is a digital platform selling tracks, albums, and other media globally. Currently, the operational data is fragmented, making it difficult to extract insights on sales trends, customer behavior, product popularity, and employee performance. To address this, a centralized data warehouse will be designed using the Chinook dataset.
